- `figures/`: Folder containing the generated figures as .pdf or .png
  files.
- `data/`: Folder containing the data used in the empirical application.
- `results/`: Folder containing intermediary results which were
  generated using a computer cluster.
- `computer_cluster_scripts/`: Folder containing the computer cluster
  scripts.
- `figure_[x].R`: R scripts to generate the respective figures.
- `table_[x].R`: R scripts to generate the respective tables.
