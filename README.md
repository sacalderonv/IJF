## Overview

This is a repository for  replications of some results for paper "Bayesian estimation of a multivariate TAR model when the noise process distribution belongs to the class of Gaussian variance mixtures"

The main contents of the repository are the following:

-`R Files for 2 reg estimation, missespecification and identify Distribution/`: Folder containing 3 R scripts and 1 rds file where were stored 1000 replications in order to get whole results of table 10 and student-t columns of tables 1,2 and 5 for M1 structure model.
- `R files for 3 reg/`: Folder containing 3 R scripts and 6 rds file where were stored 1000 replications in order to get whole results of table 3 and 6 for M2 structure model.
- `data/`: Folder containing the data used in the empirical application.
- `bayesianVARs_0.1.3.tar.gz`: Source files of the R package
  [bayesianVARs](https://luisgruber.github.io/bayesianVARs/) (0.1.3).
- `bayesianVARs_0.1.3.zip`: A .zip file containing the binary builds of
  the R package
  [bayesianVARs](https://luisgruber.github.io/bayesianVARs/) (0.1.3).
